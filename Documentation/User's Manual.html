            Dave (data vaults on web) wants to enchance the security of the data
            transfered and stored in the on-line enviroment. Therefore, the owner of a website
            wants his stite's forms data to be stored securely so he will integrate in his site(s)
            a JS file (downloaded from our website), file wich will encrypt the form data then send it 
            to the server to be stored. <br><br>
            The user will create an account on our site. At that moment, an alghoritm will link
            his data to a <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">RSA</a> set of keys. When
            logged in, the user can request a <b>javascript</b> chunk of code that he can insert
            in his form-page so that the sent data will be cripted with the <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">AES</a>
            alghoritm, using the RSA key. The user can also view the data that had passed his
            form and was successsfully encripted and stored in the data base.

            <p>
               After you log in, you will be redirected to your Dashboard Page. Here you can download your

               <img  src="https://i.imgur.com/f6jekpu.png" height="350"> <br><br>
               After you put the file in your site's sources, some form data needs to be entered on your site
               for it to be displayed in the specified DataBase Selector. <br>
               After some data is entered in your site(s) forms, you can see your database for each one of those
               using the selector:<br><br>

                You can also see the new Updates on the JS File (or whether or not you have to donload it again),
                on our website as well and of course updates on how your data is stored/encrypted.
