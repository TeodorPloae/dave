                                On our first encounter with the project we tryed to determine what is the
                                concept of what whe are implementeing. We soon realised that we need an
                                tackle plan for this. Thus we started developing concepts and ideas of how
                                the project should look and behave.
                            </p>

                                We started simple! The fact that a <b>form</b> was needed was obviously.
                                A core concept started to matearialize. It was ugly and simple but a starting
                                point none the less. We tryed to make it accesible for every type of user by
                                assigning each <b>input</b> with an appropriate <b>label</b>.
                            </p>

                                Some stylish new(old) form took the place of the first prototype. Here you can see
                                the color scheme that was chosen as well as the more intuitive theme (mark the round
                                button an the cryptic text). Also now its a <b>GRID</b> for responsiveness purposes.

                                but a page nonetheless. Some tweaks may appear here and there but the ideea is there.

                                With great joy we announce that we have introduced <b>FIREBASE API</b> in our project.
                                With this we will be able to establish an interaction with the database as well
                                as a file management system.

                                and we found out so many useful stuff. This being our first project working with
                                an <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Programming_Interface"><b>API</b></a>
                                we were surprise by the multitude of tools that are now at our disposal (Auth and

                            <p>
                                For our project we were thrilled to find out that we can use theese services for:
                                authenticating the user,
                                storing the JS file and storing the user's sites' data - all of this at the span of "a
                                3-line piece of code".
                                We found out that Firebase uses very intuitive methods for its services such as:
                                createUserAndRetrieveDataWithEmailAndPassword(), createUserWithEmailAndPassword(),
                                fetchSignInMethodsForEmail()
                                and so the process of integrating it to our project was pretty much easy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First we initialized firebase's services for our project introducing the
                                firebaseLoad.js where we linked
                                the services' URLs according to what we need:
                            </p>

                            <h4>Authentication</h4>
                            <p>
                                Using this api facilitates the process of coding in a timely manner and surprisingly
                                the ease
                                is at our disposal:

                                We also found out that with the aid of Firebase's inteface we can easily see what we
                                have
                                stored and how theese methods work
                                (how data is actually created and put in the database: each user created has a list of
                                attributes such as an unique UID,
                                the date at wich was created, the last login date and his unique email):

                                From the Database sevice of Firebase we chose to use Realtime Database for storing
                                user's
                                sites' data.
                                Realtime Database uses a noSql type of database wich greatly applies to our type of
                                application
                                - we need to store data
                                under each user's unique UID (the data stored here is not only descriptional, so it's
                                not only
                                data that the user needs
                                but also data that we need such as their private and public keys for encrypting and
                                decrypting
                                their data)
                                and also the public and private keys of the server used for crypting and decrypting
                                data sent
                                over the network:

                            <p>
                                In the database each user has a "sites" component as well where we store each one of
                                its user's
                                data under their unique ID (timeStamp).
                                All the data stored here is encrypted using the AES algorithm based on the "iv"
                                encryption
                                array as follows:

                            <h4>Storage</h4>
                            <p>
                                We used this service for storing the JS File that the user is going to add to his
                                site(s).
                            </p>

                    The user will create an account on our site. At that moment, an alghoritm will link
                    his data to a <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">RSA</a> set of keys. When
                    logged in, the user can request a <b>javascript</b> chunk of code that he can insert
                    in his form-page so that the sent data will be cripted with the <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">AES</a>
                    alghoritm, using the RSA key. The user can also view the data that had passed his
                    form and was successsfully encripted and stored in the data base.
